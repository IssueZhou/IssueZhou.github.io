        The directional band gap is studied by constructing an asymmetric 2D phononic crystal structure in COMSOL. Then I analytically calculate and simulate the band structures from different directions of this special phononic crystal. Based on this, I further explore the mechanical modes under optical traps of different optical spring strengths. The localization modes induced by defect are also studied.

        We report a self-powered multimodal temperature and force sensor based on the reverse electrowetting effect and the thermogalvanic effect in a liquid droplet. The deformation of the droplet and the temperature difference across the droplet can induce an alternating pulse voltage and a direct voltage, respectively, which is easy to separate/analyze and can be utilized to sense the external force and temperature simultaneously. In addition, an integral display system that can derive information from external temperature/force concurrently is constructed.

        To avoid the limitations of traditional solid-state thermoelectric materials, such as frangibility and complex fabrication processes, we fabricated two types of thermogalvanic gel electrolytes with positive and negative thermo-electrochemical Seebeck coefficients, respectively, which correspond to the n-type and p-type elements of a conventional thermoelectric generator. Based on these electrolytes, a flexible and wearable thermocell was designed with an output voltage approaching 1 V by utilizing body heat.

        We performed a literature review to study the characteristics and mechanisms of graphene as a saturable absorber, as well as the Haus Master Equation which describes the passive mode-locking pulse process. The split-step Fourier transform was used to obtain the numerical solution. Based on result, the differences between graphene and semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) as saturable absorbers were analysed.

        A popular method for image de-noising is to use sparse representation, like K-SVD, which is a dictionary learning algorithm. In this work, we extended the K-SVD image de-noising method, to further improve its performance. First, the image was decomposed into overlapping blocks. Second, blocks were clustered into 8 categories based on its intra-block spatial distribution, and the image was segmented into 8 compartments. Last, K-SVD was applied to each compartment for de-noising, and de-noised compartments are combined together to obtain the de-noised image. We validated our extension using PSNR on the cameraman image and compared our results with 5 other sparse coding de-noisng methods: 1) K-SVD; 2) DCT; 3) DWT; 4) SVD; 5) PCA. Our experiments showed that the best methods are in order: Our method > K-SVD > DCT > DWT > PCA > SVD.

        Using Matlab, we developed a mathematical model for debris distribution and satellites orbits and calculated the collision probability. Considering benefit of removing debris from two parts: 1) the reduction of the collision probability of the launching satellites; 2) the reduction of the maneuvering probability of the in-orbit satellites, we used a genetic algorithm to optimize the debris removing plan for obtaining a maximum profit. Apart from financial benefit, we developed a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to consider other factors, like risk, cost, application, policy, and effect. Based on our models, we provided suggestions for private firms of the potential of the debris removing business.

        We build a geoexploration system comprised of a probe, a compass, a camera, 3 microcontrollers and an iPad. The depth and direction of the probe, the video taken from the camera, and the humidity data taken from the probe sensor will all be processed by the microcontrollers and then sent to iPad to present to users. The system is a product of a new start-up company, Wuhan Huake Xunce Technology Co., Ltd, aimed to ease the geotechnical engineers' lives.
